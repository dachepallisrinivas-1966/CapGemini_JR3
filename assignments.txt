An Event Management Company "Pride Moments" want you to develop an application
to keep track of their events.
Each event should have an id, title, dateScheduled, location, cost
Requirements are as follows.
a) It should be able to add a new event
b) Should be able to remove an event
c) List all the events in the ascending order of dateScheduled
d) List all the events in the alphabetical order of location
e) List all the events of a particular location
f) List all the events of a particular dateScheduled
write a menu-driven application.
Events should be persisted.

follow multi-layered architecture.

55) add test cases for the service layer.
    write as many test cases as you can.


Steps for 54 and 55:
---------------------
1. create a new java project
2. create the packages (exception, model, dao, service, ui)
3. create user defined exception (EventManagementException)
4. create the model (Event)
5. create the DAO - Interface (IOStreamDAO), Implemenation class (IOStreamDAOImpl)
                    List<Event> listAllEvents(String location)
                    List<Event> listAllEvents(LocalDate dateScheduled)

6. create the Service - Interface, Implementation class 
        validations 
        call DAO methods
        comparators - DateScheduledComparator, LocationComparator

    public class DateScheduledComparator implements Comparator<Event>{

        @Override
        public int compare(Event) o1, Event o2) {
            LocalDate firstDate = o1.getDateScheduled();
            LocalDate otherDate = o2.getDateScheduled();
            ...
        }
        
    }


7. write the main program.


8. create gradle project - put necessary entries in build.gradle
9. copy all packages from previous project to src/main/java of gradle project
10. src/test/java
        test class
        include test cases for add()

            testAddEvent(Event event) {
                Event e = new Event("E1", " ... ", " ..", " ..." , ...);
                String expected = "E1";
                String actual = service.add(e);
                assertEquals(expected, actual);
            }

            testAddEvent which handle exception also.

            if it succeeds it should return id
            if it fails it should return exception







Day - 13
----------------------------------------------------------------------
56) create a table with the following fields.

    sales - itemno, itemname, purdate, qty
    insert atleast 3 rows.
    modify any row.
    delete any row.
    delete remaining rows.
    remove the table permantly.

57) create tables of "Invoice Report" Case Study

58) create  tables for "Order Processing System" Case Study.

    custmast
    ---------

    custname    (v) (nn)
    address     (v)
    phone       (v) (u)   

    fields like phone number, aadhar number, pincode we should not use int type.
    char or varchar only should be used as per the standard.
    because we never perform any arithmetic operation with thse fields.
    aadhar  - char(12)
    pincode - char(6)
    phone   - varchar(10)

    itemmast
    --------
    itemno      (ai) (i) (p)
    itemname    (v)  (nn)
    unitrate    (f)  (must be non-zero and non-negative)
    opstock     (i)


    ordermast
    ---------
    orderno     (ai) (i)  (p)
    orderdate   (d)  default is system date
    custno      (i) (f) 
    ordervalue  (f) 

    
    orderdetails
    ------------
    orderno     (i) (f)
    itemno      (i) (f)
    qty         (i)     (qty should be non-zero non-negative)

    insert atleast 5 meaningful rows in each table.
